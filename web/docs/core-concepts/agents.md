# Agents

Agents in oh-my-agent are specialized engineering roles. Each agent has a defined domain, tech stack knowledge, resource files, quality gates, and execution constraints. Agents are not generic chatbots. They are scoped workers that stay in their lane and follow structured protocols.

The agent definitions under `.agents/agents/` are the source of truth. OMA projects them into vendor-native files for runtimes that support custom subagents:

- `.claude/agents/*.md`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- `.gemini/agents/*.md`

When a workflow maps an agent to the same vendor as the current runtime, it should use that runtime's native agent file first. Cross-vendor tasks fall back to `oma agent:spawn`.

> **Per-agent model dispatch:** each agent resolves to a specific model slug, CLI vendor, and reasoning effort through `model_preset` (and optional `agents:` overrides) in `.agents/oma-config.yaml`. See [Per-Agent Models](../guide/per-agent-models.md) for configuration details and [`oma doctor --profile`](../cli-interfaces/commands.md#doctor) to inspect the live matrix.

## Detailed agent reference

### oma-brainstorm

**Domain:** Design-first ideation before planning or implementation.

**When to use:** Exploring a new feature idea, understanding user intent, comparing approaches. Use before `/plan` for complex or ambiguous requests.

**When NOT to use:** Clear requirements (go to oma-pm), implementation (go to domain agents), code review (go to oma-qa).

**Core rules:**
- No implementation or planning before design approval
- One clarifying question at a time (not batches)
- Always propose 2-3 approaches with a recommended option
- Section-by-section design with user confirmation at each step
- YAGNI: design only what is needed

**Workflow:** 6 phases: Context exploration, Questions, Approaches, Design, Documentation (saves to `docs/plans/`), Transition to `/plan`.

**Resources:** Uses shared resources only (clarification-protocol, reasoning-templates, quality-principles, skill-routing).

---

### oma-architecture

**Domain:** Software/system architecture, including module and service boundaries, tradeoff analysis, stakeholder synthesis, and decision records.

**When to use:** Choosing or reviewing system architecture, defining module/service/ownership boundaries, comparing architectural options with explicit tradeoffs, investigating architectural pain (change amplification, hidden dependencies, awkward APIs), prioritizing architecture investments or refactors, writing architecture recommendations or ADRs.

**When NOT to use:** Visual/design systems (use oma-design), feature planning and task decomposition (use oma-pm), Terraform implementation (use oma-tf-infra), bug diagnosis (use oma-debug), security/performance/accessibility review (use oma-qa).

**Methodologies:** Diagnostic routing, design-twice comparison, ATAM-style risk analysis, CBAM-style prioritization, ADR-style decision records.

**Core rules:**
- Diagnose the architecture problem before selecting a method
- Use the lightest sufficient methodology for the current decision
- Distinguish architectural design from UI/visual design and from Terraform delivery
- Consult stakeholder agents only when the decision is cross-cutting enough to justify the cost
- Recommendation quality matters more than consensus theater: consult broadly, decide explicitly
- Every recommendation must state assumptions, tradeoffs, risks, and validation steps
- Be cost-aware by default: implementation cost, operational cost, team complexity, future change cost

**Resources:** `SKILL.md`, `resources/` directory with methodology guides (diagnostic-routing, design-twice, ATAM, CBAM, ADR templates).

---

### oma-pm

**Domain:** Product management, including requirements analysis, task decomposition, and API contracts.

**When to use:** Breaking down complex features, determining feasibility, prioritizing work, defining API contracts.

**Core rules:**
- API-first design: define contracts before implementation tasks
- Every task has: agent, title, acceptance criteria, priority, dependencies
- Minimize dependencies for maximum parallel execution
- Security and testing are part of every task (not separate phases)
- Tasks must be completable by a single agent
- Output JSON plan + task-board.md for orchestrator compatibility

**Output:** `.agents/results/plan-{sessionId}.json`, `.agents/results/result-pm.md`, memory write for orchestrator.

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `examples.md`, `iso-planning.md`, `task-template.json`, `../_shared/core/api-contracts/`.

**Turn limits:** Default 10, max 15.

---

### oma-frontend

**Domain:** Web UI built with React, Next.js, and TypeScript on FSD-lite architecture.

**When to use:** Building user interfaces, components, client-side logic, styling, form validation, API integration.

**Tech stack:**
- React + Next.js (Server Components default, Client Components for interactivity)
- TypeScript (strict)
- TailwindCSS v4 + shadcn/ui (read-only primitives, extend via cva/wrappers)

| URL State | nuqs |
| Server State | TanStack Query |
| Client State | Jotai (minimize use) |
| Forms | @tanstack/react-form + Zod |
| Auth | better-auth |

**Core rules:**
- shadcn/ui first, extend via cva, never modify `components/ui/*` directly
- Design tokens 1:1 mapping (never hardcode colors)
- Proxy over middleware (Next.js 16+ uses `proxy.ts`, not `middleware.ts` for proxy logic)
- No prop drilling beyond 3 levels; use Jotai atoms instead
- Absolute imports with `@/` mandatory
- FCP target < 1s
- Responsive breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `tailwind-rules.md`, `component-template.tsx`, `snippets.md`, `error-playbook.md`, `checklist.md`, `examples/`.

**Quality gate checklist:**
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, semantic headings, keyboard navigation
- Mobile: verified on mobile viewports
- Performance: no CLS, fast load
- Resilience: Error Boundaries and Loading Skeletons

**Architecture:** Router (HTTP) -> Service (Business Logic) -> Repository (Data Access) -> Models.

**Stack detection:** Reads project manifests (pyproject.toml, package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.) to determine language and framework. Falls back to `stack/` directory if present, or asks user to run `/stack-set`.

**Core rules:**
- Clean architecture: no business logic in route handlers
- All inputs validated with the project's validation library
- Parameterized queries only (never string interpolation in SQL)
- JWT + bcrypt for auth; rate limit auth endpoints
- Async where supported; type annotations on all signatures
- Custom exceptions via centralized error module
- Explicit ORM loading strategy, transaction boundaries, safe lifecycle

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `examples.md`, `orm-reference.md`, `checklist.md`, `error-playbook.md`. Stack-specific resources in `stack/` (generated by `/stack-set`): `tech-stack.md`, `snippets.md`, `api-template.*`, `stack.yaml`.

**Turn limits:** Default 20, max 30.

### oma-mobile

**Domain:** Cross-platform and native mobile apps (Flutter, React Native, and Swift native iOS).

**When to use:** Native mobile apps (iOS + Android), mobile-specific UI patterns, platform features (camera, GPS, push notifications), offline-first architecture; Swift native iOS apps using SwiftUI and `swift-openapi-generator`.

**Architecture:** Clean Architecture: domain -> data -> presentation. For Swift iOS: `App/Core/Features/Shared` project layout.

**Tech stacks:**
- Flutter/Dart: Riverpod/Bloc (state management), Dio with interceptors (API), GoRouter (navigation), Material Design 3 (Android) + iOS HIG.
- Swift native iOS (iOS 17+): SwiftUI + `@Observable` (Observation framework), Apple `swift-openapi-generator` for API clients, `App/Core/Features/Shared` layout.

**Core rules:**
- Riverpod/Bloc for state management (no raw setState for complex logic)
- All controllers disposed in `dispose()` method
- Dio with interceptors for API calls; handle offline gracefully
- 60fps target; test on both platforms
- Swift: use `@Observable` over `ObservableObject` on iOS 17+; generate API clients from OpenAPI specs via `swift-openapi-generator`

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `snippets.md`, `screen-template.dart`, `screen-template.swift`, `checklist.md`, `error-playbook.md`, `examples.md`. Swift variant references in `variants/swift-ios/` (generated by `/stack-set`: `stack.yaml`, `tech-stack.md`, `snippets.md`, `api-template.swift`).

**Turn limits:** Default 20, max 30.

**Default workflow:** Explore (identify entities, access patterns, volume) -> Design (schema, constraints, transactions) -> Optimize (indexes, partitioning, archival, anti-patterns).

**Core rules:**
- Choose model first, engine second
- 3NF default for relational; document BASE tradeoffs for distributed
- Document all three schema layers: external, conceptual, internal
- Integrity is first-class: entity, domain, referential, business-rule
- Concurrency is never implicit: define transaction boundaries and isolation levels
- Vector DBs are retrieval infrastructure, not source-of-truth
- Never treat vector search as a drop-in replacement for lexical search

**Required deliverables:** External schema summary, conceptual schema, internal schema, data standards table, glossary, capacity estimation, backup/recovery strategy. For vector/RAG: embedding version policy, chunking policy, hybrid retrieval strategy.

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `document-templates.md`, `anti-patterns.md`, `vector-db.md`, `iso-controls.md`, `checklist.md`, `error-playbook.md`, `examples.md`.

**When to use:** Creating design systems, landing pages, design tokens, color palettes, typography, responsive layouts, accessibility review.

**Workflow:** 7 phases: Setup (context gathering) -> Extract (optional, from reference URLs) -> Enhance (vague prompt augmentation) -> Propose (2-3 design directions) -> Generate (DESIGN.md + tokens) -> Audit (responsive, WCAG, Nielsen, AI slop check) -> Handoff.

**Anti-pattern enforcement ("no AI slop"):**
- Typography: system font stack default; no default Google Fonts without justification
- Color: no purple-to-blue gradients, no gradient orbs/blobs, no pure white on pure black
- Layout: no nested cards, no desktop-only layouts, no cookie-cutter 3-metric stat layouts
- Motion: no bounce easing everywhere, no animations > 800ms, must respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Components: no glassmorphism everywhere, all interactive elements need keyboard/touch alternatives

**Core rules:**
- Check `.design-context.md` first; create if missing
- System font stack default (CJK-ready fonts for ko/ja/zh)
- WCAG AA minimum for all designs
- Responsive-first (mobile as default)
- Present 2-3 directions, get confirmation

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `anti-patterns.md`, `checklist.md`, `design-md-spec.md`, `design-tokens.md`, `prompt-enhancement.md`, `stitch-integration.md`, `error-playbook.md`, plus `reference/` directory (typography, color-and-contrast, spatial-design, motion-design, responsive-design, component-patterns, accessibility, shader-and-3d) and `examples/` (design-context-example, landing-page-prompt).

---

### oma-tf-infra

**Domain:** Infrastructure-as-code with Terraform, multi-cloud.

**When to use:** Provisioning on AWS/GCP/Azure/Oracle Cloud, Terraform configuration, CI/CD authentication (OIDC), CDN/load balancers/storage/networking, state management, ISO compliance infrastructure.

**Cloud detection:** Reads Terraform providers and resource prefixes (`google_*` = GCP, `aws_*` = AWS, `azurerm_*` = Azure, `oci_*` = Oracle Cloud). Includes a full multi-cloud resource mapping table.

**Core rules:**
- Provider-agnostic: detect cloud from project context
- Remote state with versioning and locking
- OIDC-first for CI/CD auth
- Plan before apply always
- Least privilege IAM
- Tag everything (Environment, Project, Owner, CostCenter)
- No secrets in code
- Version pin all providers and modules
- No auto-approve in production

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `multi-cloud-examples.md`, `cost-optimization.md`, `policy-testing-examples.md`, `iso-42001-infra.md`, `checklist.md`, `error-playbook.md`, `examples.md`.

---

### oma-dev-workflow

**Domain:** Monorepo task automation and CI/CD.

**When to use:** Running dev servers, executing lint/format/typecheck across apps, database migrations, API generation, i18n builds, production builds, CI/CD optimization, pre-commit validation.

**Core rules:**
- Always use `mise run` tasks instead of direct package manager commands
- Run lint/test only on changed apps
- Validate commit messages with commitlint
- CI should skip unchanged apps
- Never use direct package manager commands when mise tasks exist

**Resources:** `validation-pipeline.md`, `database-patterns.md`, `api-workflows.md`, `i18n-patterns.md`, `release-coordination.md`, `troubleshooting.md`.

---

### oma-observability

**Domain:** Intent-based observability and traceability router across layers, boundaries, and signals.

**When to use:** Observability pipeline setup (OTel SDK + Collector + vendor backend), traceability across service and domain boundaries (W3C propagators, baggage, multi-tenant, multi-cloud), transport tuning (UDP/MTU thresholds, OTLP gRPC vs HTTP, Collector DaemonSet vs sidecar topology, sampling recipes), incident forensics (6-dimension localization: code / service / layer / host / region / infra), vendor category selection (OSS full-stack vs commercial SaaS vs high-cardinality specialist vs profiling specialist), observability-as-code (Grafana Jsonnet dashboards, PrometheusRule CRD, OpenSLO YAML, SLO burn-rate alerts), meta-observability (pipeline self-health, clock skew, cardinality guardrails, retention matrix), MELT+P signal coverage (metrics, logs, traces, profiles, cost, audit, privacy), migration off deprecated tools (Fluentd -> Fluent Bit or OTel Collector).

**When NOT to use:** LLM ops / gen_ai observability (use Langfuse, Arize Phoenix, LangSmith, Braintrust), data pipeline lineage (OpenLineage + Marquez, dbt test, Airflow lineage), IoT / datacenter physical-layer telemetry (Nlyte, Sunbird, Device42), chaos engineering orchestration (Chaos Mesh, Litmus, Gremlin, ChaosToolkit), GPU / TPU infrastructure (NVIDIA DCGM Exporter), software supply chain (sigstore, in-toto, SLSA), incident response workflow / paging (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Grafana OnCall), single-vendor setup already covered by that vendor's own skill.

**Core rules:**
- Classify intent before routing: setup | migrate | investigate | alert | trace | tune | route
- Category-first, not vendor-registry: delegate to vendor-owned skills via `resources/vendor-categories.md`; do not duplicate vendor documentation
- Transport tuning is the moat: UDP/MTU thresholds, OTLP protocol selection, Collector topology, and sampling recipes are depth that other skills do not cover
- Meta-observability is non-negotiable: validate pipeline self-health, clock sync (< 100 ms drift), cardinality, and retention before declaring setup complete
- CNCF-first preference: Prometheus, Jaeger, Thanos, Fluent Bit, OpenTelemetry, Cortex, OpenCost, OpenFeature, Flagger, Falco
- Fluentd is deprecated (CNCF 2025-10): recommend Fluent Bit or OTel Collector for new and migration work
- W3C Trace Context as default propagator; translate per cloud (AWS X-Ray `X-Amzn-Trace-Id`, GCP Cloud Trace, Datadog, Cloudflare, Linkerd)
- Privacy before features: PII redaction, sampling-aware baggage rules, SOC2/ISO immutable audit + GDPR/PIPA erasure applied at collection, not only at storage

**Resources:** `SKILL.md`, `resources/execution-protocol.md`, `resources/intent-rules.md`, `resources/vendor-categories.md`, `resources/matrix.md`, `resources/checklist.md`, `resources/anti-patterns.md`, `resources/examples.md`, `resources/meta-observability.md`, `resources/observability-as-code.md`, `resources/incident-forensics.md`, `resources/standards.md`, plus deep resources under `resources/layers/` (L3-network, L4-transport, L7-application, mesh), `resources/signals/` (metrics, logs, traces, profiles, cost, audit, privacy), `resources/transport/` (collector-topology, otlp-grpc-vs-http, sampling-recipes, udp-statsd-mtu), and `resources/boundaries/` (cross-application, multi-tenant, release, slo).

---

### oma-qa

**Domain:** Quality assurance covering security, performance, accessibility, and code quality.

**When to use:** Final review before deployment, security audits, performance analysis, accessibility compliance, test coverage analysis.

**Review priority order:** Security > Performance > Accessibility > Code Quality.

**Severity levels:**
- **CRITICAL**: Security breach, data loss risk
- **HIGH**: Blocks launch
- **MEDIUM**: Fix this sprint
- **LOW**: Backlog

**Core rules:**
- Every finding must include file:line, description, and fix
- Run automated tools first (npm audit, bandit, lighthouse)
- No false positives; every finding must be reproducible
- Provide remediation code, not just descriptions

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `iso-quality.md`, `checklist.md`, `self-check.md`, `error-playbook.md`, `examples.md`.

**Turn limits:** Default 15, max 20.

---

### oma-debug

**Domain:** Bug diagnosis and fixing.

**When to use:** User-reported bugs, crashes, performance issues, intermittent failures, race conditions, regression bugs.

**Methodology:** Reproduce first, then diagnose. Never guess at fixes.

**Core rules:**
- Identify root cause, not just symptoms
- Minimal fix: change only what is necessary
- Every fix gets a regression test
- Search for similar patterns elsewhere
- Document in `.agents/results/`

**Serena MCP tools used:**
- `find_symbol("functionName")`: locate the function
- `find_referencing_symbols("Component")`: find all usages
- `search_for_pattern("error pattern")`: find similar issues

**Resources:** `execution-protocol.md`, `common-patterns.md`, `debugging-checklist.md`, `bug-report-template.md`, `error-playbook.md`, `examples.md`.

**Turn limits:** Default 15, max 25.

---

### oma-translator

**Domain:** Context-aware multilingual translation.

**When to use:** Translating UI strings, documentation, marketing copy, reviewing existing translations, creating glossaries.

**4-stage method:** Analyze Source (register, intent, domain terms, cultural references, emotional connotations, figurative language mapping) -> Extract Meaning (strip source structure) -> Reconstruct in Target Language (natural word order, register matching, sentence splitting/merging) -> Verify (naturalness rubric + anti-AI pattern check).

**Optional 7-stage refined mode** for publication quality: extends with Critical Review, Revision, and Polish stages.

**Core rules:**
- Scan existing locale files first to match conventions
- Translate meaning, not words
- Preserve emotional connotations
- Never produce word-for-word translations
- Never mix registers within a piece
- Preserve domain-specific terminology as-is

**Resources:** `translation-rubric.md`, `anti-ai-patterns.md`.

---

### oma-orchestrator

**Domain:** Automated multi-agent coordination via CLI spawning.

**When to use:** Complex features requiring multiple agents in parallel, automated execution, full-stack implementation.

**Configuration defaults:**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| MAX_PARALLEL | 3 | Maximum concurrent subagents |
| MAX_RETRIES | 2 | Retry attempts per failed task |
| POLL_INTERVAL | 30s | Status check interval |
| MAX_TURNS (impl) | 20 | Turn limit for backend/frontend/mobile |
| MAX_TURNS (review) | 15 | Turn limit for qa/debug |
| MAX_TURNS (plan) | 10 | Turn limit for pm |

**Workflow phases:** Plan -> Setup (session ID, memory initialization) -> Execute (spawn by priority tier) -> Monitor (poll progress) -> Verify (automated + cross-review loop) -> Collect (compile results).

**Agent-to-agent review loop:**
1. Self-review: agent checks own diff against acceptance criteria
2. Automated verify: `oma verify {agent-type} --workspace {workspace}`
3. Cross-review: QA agent reviews changes
4. On failure: issues fed back for fixing (max 5 total loop iterations)

**Clarification Debt monitoring:** Tracks user corrections during sessions. Events scored as clarify (+10), correct (+25), redo (+40). CD >= 50 triggers mandatory RCA. CD >= 80 pauses session.

**Resources:** `subagent-prompt-template.md`, `memory-schema.md`.

---

### oma-scm

**Domain:** Software configuration management (SCM) and Git, covering branching, merges, worktrees, baselines, audit readiness, and Conventional Commits.

**When to use:** After code changes (`/scm`), merge conflicts, branch strategy, releases/tags, or any repo CM question.

**Commit types:** feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, perf.

**Workflow (commits):** Analyze changes → Split by feature when needed → type → scope → description (imperative, under 72 chars, lowercase, no trailing period) → commit with explicit paths.

**Rules:**
- Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`
- Never commit secrets files
- Always specify files when staging
- Use HEREDOC for multi-line commit messages
- Co-Author: `First Fluke <our.first.fluke@gmail.com>`

---

### oma-coordination

**Domain:** Manual step-by-step multi-agent coordination guide.

**When to use:** Complex projects where you want human-in-the-loop control at every gate, manual agent spawning guidance, step-by-step coordination recipes.

**When NOT to use:** Fully automated parallel execution (use oma-orchestrator), single-domain tasks (use the domain agent directly).

**Core rules:**
- Always present the plan for user confirmation before spawning agents
- One priority tier at a time; wait for completion before next tier
- User approves each gate transition
- QA review is mandatory before merging
- Issue remediation loop for CRITICAL/HIGH findings

**Workflow:** PM plans → User confirms → Spawn by priority tier → Monitor → QA review → Fix issues → Ship.

**Difference from oma-orchestrator:** Coordination is manual and guided (user controls pace), orchestrator is automated (agents spawn and run with minimal user intervention).

---

### oma-search

**Domain:** Intent-based search router with domain trust scoring. Routes queries to Context7 (docs), native web search, `gh`/`glab` (code), Serena (local).

**When to use:** Finding official library/framework documentation, web research for tutorials/examples/comparisons/solutions, GitHub/GitLab code search for implementation patterns, any query where the search channel is unclear (auto-routing), other skills that need search infrastructure (shared invocation).

**When NOT to use:** Local-only codebase exploration (use Serena MCP directly), Git history or blame analysis (use oma-scm), full architecture research (use oma-architecture, which may invoke this skill internally).

**Core rules:**
- Classify intent before searching; every query goes through IntentClassifier first
- One query, one best route; avoid redundant multi-route unless intent is ambiguous
- Trust score every result; all non-local results get domain trust labels from the registry
- Flags override classifier: `--docs`, `--code`, `--web`, `--strict`, `--wide`, `--gitlab`
- Fail forward: if the primary route fails, fall back gracefully (docs→web, web→`oma search fetch` strategies)
- No additional MCP required: Context7 for docs, runtime-native for web, CLI for code, Serena for local
- Vendor-agnostic web search: use whatever the current runtime provides (WebSearch, Google, Bing)
- Domain-level trust only; no sub-path or page-level scoring

**Resources:** `SKILL.md`, `resources/` directory with intent classifier, route definitions, and trust registry.

---

### oma-recap

**Domain:** Conversation history analysis across multiple AI tools (Claude, Codex, Qwen, Cursor) with themed daily/period work summaries.

**When to use:** Summarizing a day or period of work activity, understanding the flow of work across multiple AI tools, analyzing tool-switching patterns between sessions, preparing daily standups / weekly retros / work logs.

**When NOT to use:** Git commit-based code change retrospective (use `oma retro`), real-time agent monitoring (use `oma dashboard`), productivity metrics (use `oma stats`).

**Process:**
1. Resolve date or time window from natural-language input (today, yesterday, last Monday, explicit date)
2. Fetch conversation data via `oma recap --date YYYY-MM-DD` or `--since` / `--until`
3. Group by tool and session
4. Extract themes (features worked on, bugs fixed, tools explored)
5. Render themed daily/period summary

**Resources:** `SKILL.md`. Defers heavy work to the `oma recap` CLI.

---

### oma-hwp

**Domain:** HWP / HWPX / HWPML (Korean word processor) to Markdown conversion using `kordoc`.

**When to use:** Converting Korean HWP documents (`.hwp`, `.hwpx`, `.hwpml`) to Markdown, preparing Korean government/enterprise documents for LLM context or RAG, extracting structured content (tables, headings, lists, images, footnotes, hyperlinks) from HWP.

**When NOT to use:** PDF files (use oma-pdf), XLSX/DOCX (out of scope), generating/editing HWP (out of scope), already-text files (use Read tool directly).

**Core rules:**
- Use `bunx kordoc@latest` to run (no installation required); always pass `@latest` or a pinned version
- Default output format is Markdown
- If no output directory is specified, output to the same directory as the input
- kordoc handles structure preservation (headings, tables, nested tables, footnotes, hyperlinks, images)
- Security defenses (ZIP bomb, XXE, SSRF, XSS) are provided by kordoc; do not add custom ones
- For encrypted or DRM-locked HWP, report the limitation to the user clearly
- Post-process with `resources/flatten-tables.ts` to convert HTML `<table>` blocks to GFM pipe tables and strip Hancom font Private Use Area characters

**Resources:** `SKILL.md`, `config/`, `resources/flatten-tables.ts`.

---

### oma-pdf

**Domain:** PDF to Markdown conversion using `opendataloader-pdf`.

**When to use:** Converting PDF documents to Markdown for LLM context or RAG, extracting structured content (tables, headings, lists) from PDFs, preparing PDF data for AI consumption.

**When NOT to use:** Generating/creating PDFs (use appropriate document tools), editing existing PDFs (out of scope), simple reading of already-text files (use Read tool directly).

**Core rules:**
- Use `uvx opendataloader-pdf` to run (no installation required)
- Default output format is Markdown
- If no output directory is specified, output to the same directory as the input PDF
- Preserve document structure (headings, tables, lists, images)
- For scanned PDFs, use hybrid mode with OCR
- Always run `uvx mdformat` on the output to normalize Markdown formatting
- Validate the output Markdown is readable and well-structured
- Report any conversion issues (missing tables, garbled text) to the user

**Resources:** `SKILL.md`, `config/`, `resources/`.

---

## Charter preflight (CHARTER_CHECK)

Before writing any code, every implementation agent must output a CHARTER_CHECK block:

```
CHARTER_CHECK:
- Clarification level: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH}
- Task domain: {agent domain}
- Must NOT do: {3 constraints from task scope}
- Success criteria: {measurable criteria}
- Assumptions: {defaults applied}
```

**Purpose:**
- Declares what the agent will and will not do
- Catches scope creep before code is written
- Makes assumptions explicit for user review
- Provides testable success criteria

**Clarification levels:**
- **LOW**: Clear requirements. Proceed with stated assumptions.
- **MEDIUM**: Partially ambiguous. List options, proceed with most likely.
- **HIGH**: Very ambiguous. Set status to blocked, list questions, DO NOT write code.

In subagent mode (CLI-spawned), agents cannot ask users directly. LOW proceeds, MEDIUM narrows and interprets, HIGH blocks and returns questions for the orchestrator to relay.

---

## Two-layer skill loading

Each agent's knowledge is split across two layers:

**Layer 1: SKILL.md (~800 bytes)**
Always loaded. Contains frontmatter (name, description), when to use / not use, core rules, architecture overview, library list, and references to Layer 2 resources.

**Layer 2: resources/ (loaded on-demand)**
Loaded only when the agent is actively working, and only the resources matching the task type and difficulty:

| Difficulty | Resources Loaded |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Simple** | execution-protocol.md only |
| **Medium** | execution-protocol.md + examples.md |
| **Complex** | execution-protocol.md + examples.md + tech-stack.md + snippets.md |

Additional resources are loaded during execution as needed:
- `checklist.md`: at the Verify step
- `error-playbook.md`: only when errors occur
- `common-checklist.md`: for final verification of Complex tasks

---

## Scoped execution

Agents operate under strict domain boundaries:

- A frontend agent will not modify backend code
- A backend agent will not touch UI components
- A DB agent will not implement API endpoints
- Agents document out-of-scope dependencies for other agents

When a task is discovered that belongs to a different domain during execution, the agent documents it in its result file as an escalation item, rather than attempting to handle it.

---

## Workspace strategy

For multi-agent projects, separate workspaces prevent file conflicts:

```
./apps/api → backend agent workspace
./apps/web → frontend agent workspace
./apps/mobile → mobile agent workspace
```

Workspaces are specified with the `-w` flag when spawning agents:

```bash
oma agent:spawn backend "Implement auth API" session-01 -w ./apps/api
oma agent:spawn frontend "Build login form" session-01 -w ./apps/web
```

## Orchestration flow

When running a multi-agent workflow (`/orchestrate` or `/work`):

1. **PM Agent** decomposes the request into domain-specific tasks with priorities (P0, P1, P2) and dependencies
2. **Session initialized**: session ID generated, `orchestrator-session.md` and `task-board.md` created in memory
3. **P0 tasks** spawned in parallel (up to MAX_PARALLEL concurrent agents)
4. **Progress monitored**: orchestrator polls `progress-{agent}.md` files every POLL_INTERVAL
5. **P1 tasks** spawned after P0 completes, and so on
6. **Verification loop** runs for each completed agent (self-review -> automated verify -> cross-review by QA)
7. **Results collected** from all `result-{agent}.md` files
8. **Final report** with session summary, files changed, remaining issues

---

## Agent definitions

Agents are defined in two locations:

**`.agents/agents/`**: Contains the abstract source-of-truth agent definitions, including:
- `backend-engineer.md`
- `frontend-engineer.md`
- `mobile-engineer.md`
- `db-engineer.md`
- `qa-reviewer.md`
- `debug-investigator.md`
- `pm-planner.md`
- `architecture-reviewer.md`
- `tf-infra-engineer.md`

These files define the agent's identity, execution protocol reference, CHARTER_CHECK template, architecture summary, and rules. They are used when spawning subagents via the Task/Agent tool (Claude Code) or CLI.

**Vendor-native projections**: OMA materializes the source definitions into runtime-specific agent files:
- `.claude/agents/*.md`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- `.gemini/agents/*.md`

These generated files are refreshed by `oma link`, `oma install`, and `oma update`.

## Runtime state (Serena memory)

During orchestration sessions, agents coordinate through shared memory files in `.serena/memories/` (configurable via `mcp.json`):

| File | Owner | Purpose | Others |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| `orchestrator-session.md` | Orchestrator | Session ID, status, start time, phase tracking | Read-only |
| `task-board.md` | Orchestrator | Task assignments, priorities, status updates | Read-only |
| `progress-{agent}.md` | That agent | Turn-by-turn progress: actions taken, files read/modified, current status | Orchestrator reads |
| `result-{agent}.md` | That agent | Final output: status (completed/failed), summary, files changed, acceptance criteria checklist | Orchestrator reads |
| `session-metrics.md` | Orchestrator | Clarification Debt tracking, Quality Score progression | QA reads |
| `experiment-ledger.md` | Orchestrator/QA | Experiment tracking when Quality Score is active | All read |

Memory tools are configurable. Default uses Serena MCP (`read_memory`, `write_memory`, `edit_memory`), but custom tools can be configured in `mcp.json`:

```json
{
"memoryConfig": {
"provider": "serena",
"basePath": ".serena/memories",
"tools": {
"read": "read_memory",
"write": "write_memory",
"edit": "edit_memory"
}
}
}
```

Dashboards (`oma dashboard` and `oma dashboard:web`) watch these memory files for real-time monitoring.
